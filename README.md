# butterfly-led-pin Project
Butterfly shaped Hair-pin with RGB LEDs  

This project is born when I wanted to make something special for a gift.

It's a butterfly origami with LEDs stuck under the paper. An accelerometer and microcontroller allow annimations that follow the head's movement when the pin is worn.  
It is battery powered. The initial goal was to have about 4 hours of autonomy. But with the battery I has laying around (100mAh) it lasts approximatly 1.5 hour.  
When no movement is detected it transitions itself into sleep mode and can last a little more than a month.

## The LEDs
They are RGB addressable LEDs (neopixels).  
They measure 1.5x1.5mm

First test to validate I can talk to one LED  
![One LED is lit](https://informotics.fr/images/articles/Papillon/07%20-%20premier%20test%20led%20RGB.jpg)  
Second test with two LEDs and paper to test diffusion

## Sleep mode

## LEDs layout
Mapping the LEDs on the origami  
![LEDs positions marked with pencil on the butterfly's wings](https://informotics.fr/images/articles/Papillon/09%20-%20Plan%20LEDs.jpg)  
  
I drew the path for the wires and stuck double sided tape  
![image](https://informotics.fr/images/articles/Papillon/10%20-%20passage%20fils%20&%20adhesif.jpg)  
  
And then placed the LEDs. Their pads are oriented to facilitate the wiring

## Final assembly
[Test of all the LEDs before folding (youtube)](https://informotics.fr/images/articles/Papillon/12%20-%20cablage%20wip.jpg)  
During this test I noticed that the double sided tape diffuses the light, showing its shape though the paper:  
![we can see a bright square through the paper](https://informotics.fr/images/articles/Papillon/13%20-%20test%20diffusion.jpg)  
  
Before folding the origami I replaced the small squares by large patches of double sided tape.
